Movie Collection

Overview

	In this Project, CrtlZ (Kimble and Sydney) wrote a program that allows a client's movie
collection to be managed efficiently. In order to do that, we implemented a linked list
database for all of the movie entries.

Design Decisions

       The program utilizes linked lists to organize and store the movie data. This allows the
program to handle the variety of movie information in a way that is not so complex. The
program includes a menu interface that takes the user through options to manage the collection. 

Testing/Using Program 

	The program will first prompt you to enter the name of the file that has your database.
After you do that, a menu of options will show, you then choose an option by entering
the corresonding number. Then answer any other prompts that follow. We have a file
(test2.txt) included that allows for testing.

Partner Collaboration

	Collaboration was simular to the last project allthough we used discord as a form of
communication instead.
